Herd-Immunity
=============

Fork of Herd Immunity Simulator

* [Original Simulator](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ramk13/Herd-Immunity/blob/master/herd-original.html) by Shane Killian (Direct copy of http://www.shanekillian.org/herd.html as of 06/23/2014)
* [Original modified with infection counts](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ramk13/Herd-Immunity/blob/master/herd-counter.html) - Replaces the asterisks with the number of times infect() is called on each cell. Also underlines cells which were originally vaccinated.
* [Fixed version of the simulator with counts](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ramk13/Herd-Immunity/blob/master/herd-fixed.html) - Changed structure of infect to properly reflection infection chances
